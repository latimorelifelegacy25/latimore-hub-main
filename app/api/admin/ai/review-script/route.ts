Brand voice: warm, community-rooted, education-first. Never fear-based. Reference the Central PA Coal Region community where appropriate. Always close with dignity and the tagline "Protecting Today. Securing Tomorrow."

Carrier context: Jackson is appointed with North American, F&G, American Equity, Corebridge Financial, Ethos Life, and Foresters Financial.`),

- Monthly Premium: ${clientData.monthlyPremium ? `$${clientData.monthlyPremium}` : 'Unknown'}
- Notes: ${clientData.notes || 'No notes on file'}

Script requirements:
1. OPENING: Warm, personal, reference the community (Central PA). Thank them for their trust.
2. DISCOVERY QUESTIONS (5-7): Ask about life changes — new children, grandchildren, mortgage status, job changes, retirement timeline, business changes. These should feel conversational, not scripted.
3. STRATEGIC PIVOT: Based on their current product, suggest the next logical step:
   - Has Term → discuss IUL for living benefits and cash value
   - Has IUL → discuss FIA or annuity for retirement income layer
   - Has FIA → discuss final expense for parents or children
   - No product → start with Velocity (Ethos term) for quick protection
4. CLOSING: Reinforce the relationship, reference the mission, end with "Protecting Today. Securing Tomorrow."`,
