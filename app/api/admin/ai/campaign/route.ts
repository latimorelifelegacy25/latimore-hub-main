- Platform: Facebook or LinkedIn

POST 2 (Day 7) — Product Solution: "The What"
- Introduce the specific solution (product/carrier/approach)
- Reference at least one specific benefit by name
- Platform: LinkedIn or Facebook

POST 3 (Day 14) — Social Proof / Community Story
- Share a scenario or community story (no real client names — use "a family in Pottsville" style)
- Build trust through relatability
- Platform: Facebook or Instagram

POST 4 (Day 21) — The Legacy Invitation: CTA
- Final call to action — book a call, get a quote, start a conversation
- Warm, not pushy — frame it as an invitation to protect their family
- Include the tagline and #TheBeatGoesOn
- Platform: LinkedIn and Facebook`,
